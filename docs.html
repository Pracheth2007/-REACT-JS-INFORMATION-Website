<h1>Getting Started</h1>   
<h2>This page is an overview of the React documentation and related resources.</h2>
<p><h3>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our homepage or in the tutorial.

<p>
<h1>Try React</h1>
<h3>
<p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as</p>
<p>much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity</p>
<p>to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will</p>
<p>help you get started.</p>
</h3>

<h2>Online Playgrounds</h2>
<h3>
<p>If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try</p>
<p>a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, Glitch, or Stackblitz.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and</p>
<p>open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation,</p>
<p>so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.</p>
</h3>

<h2>Add React To A Website</h2>
<h3>
<p>You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its</p>
<p>presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.</p>
</h3>
<h2>Create a New React App</h2>
<h3>
<p>When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best</p>
<p>option. It only takes a minute to set up!</p>
<p>As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are</p>
<p>several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work</p>
<p>with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.</p>
</h3>

<h1>Learn React</h1>
<h3>
<p>People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether</p>
<p>you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.</p>
</h3>
<h2>First Examples</h2>
<h3>
<p>The React homepage contains a few small React examples with a live editor. Even if you don’t</p>
<p>know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.</p>
</h3>
<h2>React For Beginners</h2>
<h3>
<p>If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with,</p>
<p>check out this overview of React by Tania Rascia. It introduces the most important React</p>
<p>concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation</p>
<p>another try!</p>
</h3>
<h2>React for Designers</h2>
<h3>
<p>If you’re coming from a design background, these resources are a great place to get started.</p>
</h3>
<h2>JavaScript Resources</h2>
<h3>
<p>The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript</p>
<p>language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will</p>
<p>take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.</p>
</h3>
<h2>Practical Tutorial</h2>
<h3>
<p>If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. In this tutorial, we build a tic-</p>
<p>tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not into building</p>
<p>games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to</p>
<p>building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.</p>
</h3>
<h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
<h3>
<p>If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, our guide to main concepts is the best place to</p>
<p>start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so</p>
<p>you won’t miss anything as you go along.</p>
</h3>
<h2>Thinking in React</h2>
<h3>
<p>Many React users credit reading Thinking in React as the moment React finally “clicked” for</p>
<p>them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough but it’s still just as relevant.</p>
</h3>
<h2>Recommended Courses</h2>
<h3>
<p>Sometimes people find third-party books and video courses more helpful than the official</p>
<p>documentation. We maintain a list of commonly recommended resources, some of which are</p>
<p>free.</p>
</h3>
<h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>
<h3>
<p>Once you’re comfortable with the main concepts and played with React a little bit, you might</p>
<p>be interested in more advanced topics. This section will introduce you to the powerful, but</p>
<p>less commonly used React features like context and refs.</p>
</h3>
<h2>API Reference</h2>
<h3>
<p>This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more details about a particular</p>
<p>React API. For example, React.Component API reference can provide you with details on</p>
<p>how setState() works, and what different lifecycle methods are useful for.</p>
</h3>
<h2>Glossary and FAQ</h2>
<h3>
<p>The glossary contains an overview of the most common terms you’ll see in the React</p>
<p>documentation. There is also a FAQ section dedicated to short questions and answers about</p>
<p>common topics, including making AJAX requests, component state, and file structure.</p>
</h3>
<h1>Staying Informed</h1>
<h2>
<p>The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything</p>
<p>important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.</p>
<p>You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if</p>
<p>you only read the blog.</p>
<p>Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for</p>
<p>every release in the changelog.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases</p>
<p>page.</p>
</h2>
<h1>Versioned Documentation</h1>
<h2>
<p>This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React. Since React 16, you can</p>    
<p>find older versions of the documentation on a separate page. Note that documentation for</p>    
<p>past versions is snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously updated.</p>    
</h2>
<h1>Something Missing?</h1>
<h2>
<p>If something is missing in the documentation or if you found some part confusing, please file</p>
<p>an issue for the documentation repository with your suggestions for improvement, or tweet at</p>
<p>the @reactjs account. We love hearing from you!</p>
